Boosting of local binary pattern using bag-of-filters for content based image retrieval

In this project, the methodology of a research paper(attached) has been implemented.
This project basically aims towards enchancing the local content of an image using a combination of 5 filters in such a way that it can be used in a better and faster manner for content based image retrieval or basically image matching from a database.

This project, however, is incomplete as of now.
